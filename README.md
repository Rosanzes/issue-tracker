Issue tracker - Solana Beach
===========================================

Hello and welcome! Thank you for using [Solana Beach](https://solanabeach.io)  
To keep things nice and clear, please follow these simple guidelines:

#### How do I report bugs?

1. Register for a github account or login to yours. 
2. Head over to the [Issues](https://github.com/solana-beach/issue-tracker/issues) tab
3. **Make sure your problem has NOT been reported yet**
4. Either create a new issue, or contribute to the thread **already existing for the issue**. 

#### What should I include in my report?

One bug per issue please! Don't create lists of bugs in one issue.  
The more information, the better. Basically: try to help as much as you can in identifying and fixing the problem.  
We're specifically looking for the following information:

- **Specific steps to reproduce the issue**
- Browser and version
- Operating system
- Screenshot/video
- Was there any error displayed? (Option + âŒ˜ + J (on macOS), or Shift + CTRL + J (on Windows/Linux) and focus on the Console and Network tabs)
