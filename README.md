Good afternoon, my name is Rosalía Sánchez Tornero Minaya, and on Friday at 7:40 pm I sent my Gamestock funds from my Phantom wallet (Solana account), and they are blocked in Solanabeach.io.

When am I going to received them, please?

The transaction is listed as Successful, and money is moving.

I would appreciate it if you could send it to me as soon as possible to my Solana account in my Phantom wallet. I just need my money back.

I send you the account and the Signature.

Solana account (Phantom Wallet): BxNS9ARQuyJVNHWe93R9rWwZCBuq7ipJGxjyT8tZShhQ

Thank you.

Sincerely.
